"""Download the Overture Maps extracts that colorado.py reads -> data/co/

- overture_co_bbox.parquet     every place in Colorado's bounding box (name, category, address, point)
- overture_co_sources.parquet  which datasets each Colorado eating/drinking listing came from (Meta, Foursquare, ...)
- co_shapes.json               simplified state and county outlines for the map
- co_state_detail.geojson      the state outline at full detail, for the in-state test

Reads the public Overture bucket over S3 with DuckDB (no account needed). Adapted from wi-eats/pipeline/fetch_overture.py
(Colorado has no Great Lakes shoreline to cut out).
